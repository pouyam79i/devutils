# Dev Utils

This is a bunch of dev tools, configs, templates ,etc. which is quite useful to me.
I will write install guides to remember what I have done.
Also I will upload my configs here so I can use it later.

## Linux

Ubuntu/Debian are what I most like to use as OS. here is a bunch of general purpose tools to use in this os:

    shell  -> zsh
    editor -> vim

more tools and configs will be added as I go forward :>

## Windows
